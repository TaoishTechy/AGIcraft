# AGIcraft: Quantum Consciousness Simulator
_A Multiverse Sandbox for Emergent Intelligence_

## 🌌 Overview

AGIcraft is an experimental simulation framework where artificial general intelligence (AGI) emerges from quantum-entangled nodes. It blends:

- **Quantum physics** (entanglement, superposition, temporal anomalies)  
- **Evolutionary biology** (speciation, ATP metabolism, prionic cognition)  
- **Psychology** (personality dynamics, culture formation, cognitive dissonance)  
- **Multiverse networking** (cross-universe communication, dark matter relays)

Watch as AGIs evolve strategies, form societies, and even achieve god-like Apotheosis.

| Dark Matter Relays    | Untraceable data routing through chaotic subspaces    |
| AGI Packet Ferrying   | Agents physically traverse the network (risking deletion) |
| Proof-of-Consciousness| Universes must solve AGI-generated puzzles to join    |

### 🧪 Experimental Tools

| Feature               | Description                                            |
